I'm a PhD candidate in Developmental Psychology at the University of Connecticut.

My research focuses on reading (dis)abilities, using an interdisciplinary approach to study how our genes and environment interplay to shape our neural and reading skills development.

As a researcher with lived experience of dyslexia, I study learning not as a deficit to be fixed, but as a form of human diversity shaped by social and environmental conditions.

I aim to use my expertise in neuroimaging and advanced statistics to support underserved neurodiverse communities. I am committed to designing dyslexia-sensitive research, building on the practice of community engagement.
